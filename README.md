Welcome Friend,

We are the Mozilla Campus Club at the University of Nebraska at Omaha since 2018. 

A Mozilla Club brings people together locally to build the open web on University and College campuses worldwide.

The Internet is more than computers and code. The Internet is about people. And this is what Mozilla Clubs are all about: interacting with others to share, learn, teach, protect and build upon platforms, to make things that matter. Our Clubs are human structures that make the web real.

Mozilla Campus Clubs are Mozilla Clubs that take place at a University or College - These clubs take advantage of the unique learning environments of Universities and Colleges to bring students with a passion for technology together to build and innovate on open source projects that build the open web. 

Yours,
UNO Mozilla Campus Club Presidents
